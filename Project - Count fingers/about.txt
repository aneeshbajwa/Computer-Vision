Calculating No of fingers in the Region of Interest using following steps
1. Grab a region of interest
2. calculate running aveerage of the ROI uing first sixty frames and within this duration do not let any disturbance in the ROI
3. Once average values is calculated, hand can enter in ROI
4. Once hand enters, apply thresholding to segment out hand from the background
5. Use convex hull to draw a polygon around the hand
6. using convex hull get the top most lest most and the rightmost point of the hand
7. use these point to get center of the hand and dram a circle of radius equal to the ninty percent of thedistance of center to the farthest point
8. if the point lies outside this circle then increment the count of finger by one
